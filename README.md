All input files and .dll files must be placed in the "input" folder

The project must be run in "Multiple startup Project" with 
PuppetMaster and ProcessCreationService with the action to "Start",
the others projects must have the action in "None".

The config file location is not important because it can be select manually with a file dialog.

The buttons "Start One" and "Start All" in the PuppetMaster can't be used.
